# clean-code
chapter 3
- shorter function the better 
- do one thing
- it's content should be in the same abstraction level
-long descriptive naming is better than short meaningless or long comment
-don't use switch case use rather than abstract factory to didn't violate SRP
-function arguments type monatic , dyadic , triads
-command query separation  function should do some thing or return some thing no other thing
-prefer return exception than error code because any exception derived from exception class so any class can deal with it without redeploy class
